Training for first job: 

1. Searching about component of computer
   - A. Case : a box which make for houses another part of the computer
   - B. Mother board : a curcuit board which play intermediary role between the comunication of another component
   - C. Power supply : the heart of all the computer which provide electric to all component aka a avanced adapter
   - D. CPU : < central processing unit > a extremly important unit which processing all the program in your computer like caculating, and also called the brain of the computer
   - E. RAM : < Random access memory > a component which storage data and easy to access but low spaces
   - F. Hard drive : same with RAM but with huge spaces of stroge and slow access to the data
   - G. GPU < Graphic process unit > the unit that turn Binary sequence into different pixels to display on your monitor



2. What's chat GPT?
   - chat GPT is a artifacial intelligent chat box (what is chatbox?) which develop by Open AI
   - ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that interacts in a conversational way.
   - Chat GPT can modify information in many category
   - Use Nerual network architecture to respond user
   - It is a state of NLP < natural prossesing language > which is a group of AI give the bot ability to read and answear human language 



3. What's google BARD?
 - Bard is a large language model (LLM) chatbot developed by Google AI. It is a machine learning model that has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. Bard can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way 


4. Diffirence between the chat GPT and google BAR ?
  - simularity :+ both are AI designed to answear and solve the problem that gave by the user
  - Difference : the first difference is Data resource when ChatGPT is permanent updated by developer, on the other hand BARD Data is flexiable and updated constantly
  - the second one is using case when Chat GPT is designed to answear particular question, Bard is design to augment GG's searvh engine



5. What's AI?
 - AI < artificial intelligence > is a state of computer which machine can learn understand and solve problem by the data the be given
 - is built by complex algorithms mathematical function


6. What's GITHUB and GIT?
 - GIT is system that manage your source code and able 2 or more people code together and warnning the conflict code
 - GITHUB is the forum for the coder which can easily changing or seeing another one code



7. What's Python language?
- Python is the word fastest language and the most popular in the world among the software engineers, mathematics,Data analyts,....
- python can build web, mobiles and desktops app or even hacking
- between python and the another coding language, python is simmple and friendly for beginer

8. What's Clould service?



A cloud service is a type of internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources  applications, and services)



9. What's C/C++ language?

is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.

   

11. Compairsion C/C++ with Python Language?
python is high-level language
C is middel-level language


  accessibility  - python use open source code with large area and forum for user to disscussing and chatting
                  - C also use open source code but with smaller forum and inviroment

 flexibility - python provide speed effection and easy to learn and give multy platfom and open source ability to develop
            - for some project that intergrate with microsoft some people use C

12. What's computer vision?

Images and videos will be put into a computer for processing (the computer here can be a PC, laptop, IoT device, smartphone, camera... whatever has computing power). Computer Vision can currently do the following:

Identify objects (Identify)

Object Tracking (Track)

Measurement (Measure)

Detect object (Detect)

Classify objects (Classify)








13. What's lable tools?

that tool where you can idenity object or detail form that you can detecth coordinates of your object on the picture 





14. What's labelImg tools?



LabelImg is a free, open source tool for graphically labeling images. It’s written in Python and uses QT for its graphical interface. It’s an easy, free way to label a few hundred images to try out your next object detection project.





15. What's Yolo AI models ?
 
YOLO model is a deep learning model for fast object detection. It is a single stage detector that combines the problem of drawing bounding boxes and identifying class labels in one end-to-end differentiable network1.  






17. How deploy AI models ?

Prepare a model before you deploy yolo

Create a GitHub repository for the model

Add configuration files to deploy yolo via Syndcai

Test the model locally

Deploy yolo


18. What's IDE?


Integrated Development Environment is a software to coding build and compile then run source code 
otherwise IDE can help you dectecing bug fixing bug 

19. What is anaconda?

20. What is package in python?

21. What is CUDA?
